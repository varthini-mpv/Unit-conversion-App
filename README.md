UNIT CONVERSION APP                                                                     
Creating a unit conversion application in Python can be done using a graphical user interface (GUI) library such as Tkinter. Here's a step-by-step guide to building a simple unit converter in Python using Tkinter:
Step 1: Install Tkinter
Step 2: Write the Unit Conversion Code
Explanation of the Code
1. Imports and Function Definition: The code starts by importing the necessary modules (`tkinter` and `ttk`) and defining the `convert_units` function, which handles the conversion logic.
2. Conversion Logic: Inside `convert_units`, the code retrieves the input value and the selected units, performs the conversion, and updates the `result_label`.
3. Creating the GUI: The code then creates the main window and places various widgets, such as labels, entry fields, comboboxes, and buttons, in the grid layout.
4. Event Handling: The `convert_button` is configured to call the `convert_units` function when clicked.
5. Running the Application: Finally, the `root.mainloop()` call starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the application to run and respond to user interactions.
